Hotel Management System in C++
Overview
The Hotel Management System is a console-based application built in C++ to manage hotel operations efficiently. The system automates key tasks like guest check-ins, room bookings, check-outs, billing, and room availability tracking. It is designed to make the management process more streamlined, reducing the effort required by hotel staff and enhancing user experience.

Features
Room Management: Add, modify, and delete rooms. Each room has attributes like room number, type (single, double, suite), and price.
Guest Management: Register guests, manage check-ins, and track their stay details.
Booking System: Reserve rooms for guests, providing availability checks and booking confirmations.
Billing System: Generate bills based on the stay duration and room types, calculate total charges, and handle check-out.
Data Persistence: Store guest information and room status in text files to maintain data even after the program ends.
Requirements
C++ Compiler: A working C++ environment such as GCC, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio.
Operating System: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Libraries: Uses the standard C++ libraries (such as fstream, vector, and string) for file handling and data storage.

**Installation**
**Clone the repository:**


git clone https://github.com/Henok-Demissie/hotel-management-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd hotel-management-system
Compile the project using a C++ compiler. For example, using GCC:
**bash
Copy code**
g++ hotel_management.cpp -o hotel_management
Run the program:
bash
Copy code
**./hotel_management**
Usage
Start the application: Once the program is running, a menu will display options like managing rooms, registering guests, and generating bills.
Room Management: You can add or modify rooms (e.g., setting their price, type, or availability).
Guest Management: Register a guest, check them in, or check them out.
Booking: Book a room for a guest and assign a room based on availability.
Billing: Upon checkout, the system generates a bill based on room type and stay duration.
Example Workflow
Add a Room: User can add a room by specifying room number, type (single/double), and price.
Register a Guest: The guest is assigned a room and checked in.
Check-out: On check-out, the system calculates the total bill based on the stay period and room type, and prints the final charge.
